## Assignment Description
This repository contains the code for the C Lab Assignment for COP290 course. The assignment is to implement a simplified spreadsheet program in C similar to Excel. The program stores the matrix in memory with a scrollable viewport on display. It will support the below specified functions along with lazy evaluation and storing the data on the heap to maximise the efficiency and scalability of the program.
The expressions that each cell can contain are:
1. Value
   1. Constant
   2. Reference to another cell
2. Arithmetic Operations
   1. Addition
   2. Subtraction
   3. Multiplication
   4. Division
3. Mathematical Functions
   1. Sum
   2. Average
   3. Stdev
   4. Min
   5. Max
   6. Sleep

## Features
1. The program supports the following features:
   1. Scrolling the viewport
   2. Editing the cell values
   3. Evaluating the cell expressions
   4. Undo and Redo operations
   5. Copy and Paste operations
   6. Mathematical functions
   7. Sleep function
   8. Error handling
   9. Lazy evaluation
   10. Memory management
   11. Efficient data structures
   12. Scalability
   13. Clean UI
